## 1. What is **The RSVE serial port mod for the Atari ST**, and when to use it ?

**The RSVE serial port mod for the Atari ST** is a remake of the 'RSVE' serial port upgrade for the Atari ST, that allows to use far higher speed than the stock 19.2 kbps of an unmodded computer.

This project started from [this thread at exxosforum](https://exxosforum.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=5926) and the latest pages details what has been attempted to make it work with BBS Express (tldr : at the time of writing, it works at 38kbps, but then incoming calls at slower speed does not works).
